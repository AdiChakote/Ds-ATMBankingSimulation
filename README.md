# ATM Banking System

This is a Python-based console application that simulates the core
functionalities of an ATM banking system.

The application allows users to:
- Authenticate using account credentials
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money with balance validation
- Exit safely after transactions

This project was developed to strengthen core Python programming concepts
such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and user input handling.
It also demonstrates basic logical flow used in real-world banking systems.
